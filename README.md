# viwiLocationBasedServices
This is a proposal for location based services based on Volkswagen Infotainment Web Interface protocol.

I’m currently doing my bachelor’s degree in business informatics. I plan to do some kind of interface specification for by thesis based on the REST architecture pattern. These specified services should fit into an automotive environment. After some research regarding cars, infotainment systems and REST I found the submission of (i.a.) @wzr1337 that is public on www.w3.org (https://www.w3.org/Submission/viwi-protocol/). I really like this proposal because of its simplicity and beauty. I like the idea of the event driven async websocket approach combined with the classic REST concept.

After looking for some use cases to implement I found the github account (https://github.com/GENIVI) and confluence pages (https://at.projects.genivi.org/wiki/display/PROJ/Projects+Home) of GENIVI Alliance. They attracted my attention while I searched for some connectivity projects for cars.
On there confluence pages the team of the GENIVI described some use cases (https://at.projects.genivi.org/wiki/display/NAV/IVI+NavigationW3C) for navigation and location based services where they cooperate with the W3C. I thought it would be funny to take these use cases and specify an interface based on the viwi protocol submission and examine the difference between imperative/stateful approaches and a stateless one.
